# Arcade Game Clone

This is an Arcade Game Clone created in JavaScript for the Front-End Developer NanoDegree through Udacity by Kj Kilanski.

## Instructions For Playing

1. Open the game in a browser window
2. To begin the game, press the space bar
3. Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left or right
4. If you want to pause, press the space bar to pause and start up again
5. Rocks are obstacles you will need to navigate around
6. Be sure to avoid enemies like bugs, if you collide with them, you will be sent back to the start
7. Win the game when you jump into to the water


When you finish the game, a box will be displayed letting you know you won. To reset the game and play again, you can click on the 'Reset' button. When you restart the game, the obstacles will appear in a random location.

## Dependencies

Playing the Arcade Game Clone relies on having a browser installed. The game has been tested in the following browsers:

1. Chrome
2. Firefox

## Responsive Design

The game has been styled to play on desktop computers only at this time.

## To-Do List

In the future, additional functionality will be added including different levels, scoring options, collecting gems, number of lives before the game quits, more obstacles, and responsive design to play on mobile devices.

## Code Adaptations

No code adaptations were used in this project.

## Resources

For this project, Udacity provided the starter files. These included the following:

1. index.html
2. style.css
3. engine.js
4. resources.js
5. app.js

Several changes were made to most of these files.

1. index.html - The text and the modal were added.
2. style.css - Only the body attributes were provided; All other styling was added and the body styling was updated
3. engine.js - Only minimal changes; These changes included adding additional image resources and creating a larger canvas.
4. resources.js - No changes were made.
5. app.js - The main changes in the project were in app.js. The initial file provided guidance but little remains of the original with the exception of the 'keyup' event listener and the render() methods.

There were several resources I used to complete this project. The most notable and helpful were the following:

1. MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/
2. w3schools: https://www.w3schools.com
3. http://nokarma.org/2011/02/27/javascript-game-development-keyboard-input/index.html

To get started, I consulted several projects for inspiration and to understand how to start. These include the following:

1. https://github.com/drmumford/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/blob/master/js/app.js // this is an amazing project!
2. https://github.com/bcko/Ud-FE-Frogger-JS/blob/master/js/app.js // upgrade from the most, good place for ideas
3. https://github.com/brenopolanski/udacity-classic-arcade-game-clone/blob/master/js/app.js // most basic, place to start at a basic level


If you compare my project to any of these, you will quickly see the departure from the most basic and the inspiration for some of the more complex structures.

## How to Improve

There is a lot that can be improved in my project.
1. The data structure is haphazard - Much of this is related to lack of planning, experience, and what I call 'quicksand knowledge'<br/>
   To overcome this, more experience and testing/stretching my knowledge is necessary
2. The use of super classes will help with organizing data
3. Having a better idea of the features I want to add and making a plan for adding them
